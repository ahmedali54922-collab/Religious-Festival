Christmas: Celebration of Christ's Birth
Christmas is the annual Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God. It is marked by church services, nativity plays, and the singing of carols. Popular traditions include decorating Christmas trees, exchanging gifts, and sharing a festive meal with family. It is a season of "peace on earth and goodwill to all men," emphasizing love, charity, and hope. For many, it is a time of spiritual reflection on the gift of salvation brought by Jesus.
