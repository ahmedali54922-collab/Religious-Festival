Diwali: The Festival of Lights
Diwali is one of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, symbolizing the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance." It commemorates Lord Rama's return to his kingdom, Ayodhya, after 14 years of exile and defeating the demon king Ravana. To celebrate his return, people lit oil lamps (diyas). Today, families decorate their homes with lamps, create colorful Rangoli patterns on the floor, share sweets, and burst firecrackers. It is also a time for worshipping Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity.
