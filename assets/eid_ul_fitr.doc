Eid-ul-Fitr: The Festival of Breaking the Fast
Eid-ul-Fitr is a major Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. It is a day of joy, thanksgiving, and community. Muslims gather for special prayers in the morning, dress in new clothes, and visit friends and family. A key tradition is giving "Zakat-al-Fitr" (charity) to the needy so that everyone can celebrate. Sweet dishes, especially "Sheer Khurma," are prepared and shared, earning it the name "Sweet Eid." It celebrates the spiritual strength gained during Ramadan.
