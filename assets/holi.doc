Holi: The Festival of Colors
Holi is a vibrant Hindu festival that celebrates the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. The first night is Holika Dahan, where bonfires are lit to symbolize the burning of the demoness Holika. The following day is the "Festival of Colors," where people playfully throw colored powders and water at each other. It breaks down social barriers, as everyone is equal under the colors. It also celebrates the eternal love of Radha and Krishna and the end of winter, bringing people together in joy and laughter.
